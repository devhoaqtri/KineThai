/**
 * The anonymous "something is wrong with this word" report: what a reader can say,
 * and the shape it travels in.
 *
 * A report is a word id, one or more reasons picked from a fixed list, and the page
 * of the card the reader was on. There is deliberately no free text and no reader
 * identifier, so a report cannot carry anything personal.
 *
 * Two reasons are SEVERE: "nhạy cảm" (sensitive) and "không ổn" (not okay). They are not
 * about a mistake in the card but about whether it should be shown at all, so they are
 * tinted red where a reader picks them and go to the top of the admin's queue.
 *
 * Exports: REPORT_REASONS, ReportReasonId, REPORT_REASON_IDS, getReportReason,
 *   SEVERE_REPORT_REASONS, isSevereReason, byReportPriority, toReportStage,
 *   wordReportSchema, WordReportInput, WordReport, WordReportStatus, MAX_REPORT_REASONS
 * Depends on: zod, ./target-language
